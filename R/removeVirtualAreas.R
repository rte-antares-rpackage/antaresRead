#' Remove virtual areas
#' 
#' This function removes virtual areas from an \code{antaresDataList} object and
#' corrects the data for the real areas. The \code{antaresDataList} object 
#' should contain area and link data to function correctly.
#' 
#' @param x An object of class \code{antaresDataList} with at least components 
#'   \code{areas} and \code{links}.
#' @param storageFlexibility A vector containing the names of the virtual 
#'   storage/flexibility areas.
#' @param production A vector containing the names of the virtual production 
#'   areas.
#' @param reassignCosts If TRUE, the production costs of the virtual areas are 
#'   reallocated to the real areas they are connected to. If the virtual areas 
#'   are connected to a virtual hub, their costs are first reallocated to the 
#'   hub and then the costs of the hub are reallocated to the real areas.
#' @param newCols
#'   If \code{TRUE}, new columns containing the production of the virtual
#'   areas are added. If FALSE their production is added to the production of
#'   the real areas they are connected to.
#' @param rowBal
#'   If \code{TRUE}, then BALANCE will be corrected by ROW. BAL:
#'   BALANCE := BALANCE - "ROW. BAL"
#'   
#'   
#' @return 
#' An \code{antaresDataList} object in which virtual areas have been removed and
#' data of the real has been corrected. See details for an explanation of the
#' corrections.
#'   
#' @details 
#' Two types of virtual areas have been defined corresponding to different types
#' of modeling in Antares and different types of post-treatment to do:
#'   
#' \itemize{ 
#'   \item Flexibility/storage areas are areas created to model 
#'     pumping unit or any other flexibility that behave as a storage. For those 
#'     virtual areas, the important results are flows on the links. 
#'   \item Production areas are areas created to isolate some generation from 
#'     the "real" areas. They can be isolate for several reasons: to distinguish 
#'     time-series (for example wind onshore/offshore), to select some specific 
#'     unit to participate to day-ahead reserve, etc.
#' }
#'   
#' \code{removeVirtualAreas} performs different corrections:
#'   
#' \itemize{ 
#'   \item Correct the balance of the real areas (and districts) by removing the flows
#'     to or from virtual areas.
#'   
#'   \item If parameter \code{reassignCosts} is TRUE, then the costs of the 
#'     virtual areas are reassigned to the real areas they are connected to. The
#'     affected columns are \code{OV. COST}, \code{OP. COST}, \code{CO2 EMIS.}
#'     and \code{NP COST}. If a virtual area is connected to a single real area,
#'     all its costs are attributed to the real area. If it is connected to
#'     several real areas, then costs at a given time step are divided between
#'     them proportionally to the flows between them and the virtual area.
#'     An aggregation is done at the end to correct districts costs. 
#'   
#'   \item For each storage/flexibility area, a column named like the area is 
#'     created. It contains the values of the flow between the virtual area and 
#'     the real areas. This column is interpreted as a production of
#'     electricity: it is positive if the flow from the virtual area to the real
#'     area is positive and negative otherwise. If parameter \code{newCols} is
#'     \code{FALSE}, the values are added to the variable \code{PSP} and the 
#'     columns is removed.
#'     An aggregation is done at the end to add virtual storage/flexibility to districts. 
#'     
#'   \item If the parameter \code{production} is specified, then the non null
#'     productions of the virtual areas are either added to the ones of the real 
#'     areas they are connected to if \code{newCols = FALSE} or put in new 
#'     columns if \code{newCols = TRUE}. In the second case the columns are 
#'     named \code{*_virtual} where "\code{*}" is a type of 
#'     production (wind, solar, nuclear, ...). Productions that are zero for
#'     all virtual areas are omited.
#'     If virtual production areas contains clusters then they will be move to the
#'     real area. 
#'     An aggregation is done at the end to add virtual production to districts. 
#'   
#'   \item Finally, virtual areas and the links connected to them are removed
#'     from the data. 
#' }
#'   
#' The functions makes a few assumptions about the network. If they are
#' violated it will not act correctly: 
#'   
#' \itemize{ 
#'   \item storage/flexibility
#'     areas can be connected to other storage/flexibility areas (hubs), but at 
#'     least one of them is connected to a real area. That means that there is
#'     no group of virtual areas disconnected from the real network. If such a
#'     group exists, you can either remove them manually or simply not import
#'     them.
#'   \item production areas are connected to one and only one real area. They
#'     cannot be connected to virtual areas. But a real area may by connected to
#'     several production areas.
